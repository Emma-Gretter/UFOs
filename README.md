# Overview of Project: 
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to gather UFO sighting information from around the country and compile it into a central and searchable table. 
###  Access
The table was then embedded into a website so that UFO enthusiasts around the world can easily access the information. 
## Results
The result is a webpage with an introductory paragraph and then a table with a corresponding search bar. 
### How to Use
To use the table visitors must first navigate to the webpage. Once on the page, the user would scroll down to the search bar and enter desired search criteria.

Users can filter the information in the table by date, city, state, country, or shape. For example: entering the city of Benton returns this result

## Summary 
### Limitations
This webpage and table are not interactive. There is no place for users to leave comments, submit additional sightings, or download information.
### Proposed Improvements 
-	Remove case sensitivity from search bar.

The current search bar is case sensitive while the information in the table is all lower case. This means that a search for “Florida” would not return the sightings listed in the table under “fl”. 
-	Comments need to be debugged.

There are some formatting issues with the text in the comments column of the table
